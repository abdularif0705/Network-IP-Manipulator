# Network-IP-Manipulator

## Introduction
The Network-IP-Manipulator is a Python cybersecurity tool developed to demonstrate the real-world application of network protocols and their vulnerabilities within a local area network (LAN). By leveraging multithreading and socket programming, this tool performs tasks such as identifying active devices, scanning ports, and simulating network stress via controlled TCP or UDP flood attacks. The purpose is to unearth and understand potential vulnerabilities within Wi-Fi network structures.

## Functionality
Emphasizing a hands-on approach to cybersecurity, the tool provides key insights into network stability and security through a suite of features, including live host detection, port scanning, and orchestrated network load testing via TCP/UDP flooding.

## Project Overview
As a capstone project for a Computer Networks course, this application reflects a deep dive into networking concepts. Created by myself and my colleague Brett, it stands as a collaborative creation that underlines the practical application of theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## Features
The Network-IP-Manipulator is equipped with:
- **IP Online Detection**: Monitors and reports the status of devices within a network.
- **Specific Port Detection**: Assesses the openness of designated ports on devices, analyzing the security posture of network ports.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: Employs TCP/UDP flood attacks to test network fortitude.
- **Node Geolocation Mapping**: Determines the geographical location of networked devices.
- **Network Topography Scan**: Provides a detailed layout of networked devices, mapping out the LAN, listing IP and MAC addresses of all active hosts.

### Career Advancement
Following the project's implementation, I was honoured with an offer to join the faculty as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Networks course. This opportunity was in recognition of my exemplary skills and solid understanding of complex networking concepts, underscored by the successful deployment of this project.
