# Network-IP-Manipulator

## Introduction
The Network-IP-Manipulator is a Python cybersecurity tool developed to expose and assess network protocol vulnerabilities within local area networks (LANs). Leveraging multithreading and socket programming, it identifies active devices, scans ports, and simulates network stress with TCP or UDP flood attacks, offering a practical exploration of Wi-Fi network vulnerabilities.

## Project Overview
As a capstone project for a Computer Networks course, this application reflects a deep dive into networking concepts. Developed collaboratively with my colleague Brett, the project embodies a practical application of networking principles, bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world network security practices.

## Features
- **IP Online Detection**: Monitors and reports the status of devices within a network.
- **Specific Port Detection**: Evaluates the security of network ports by assessing their accessibility.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: Executes TCP/UDP flood attacks to assess the resilience of networks under high traffic conditions.
- **Node Geolocation Mapping**: Identifies the physical locations of network nodes.
- **Network Topography Scan**: Scans and maps out the LAN, listing IP and MAC addresses of all active hosts.

### Career Advancement
The successful deployment of this project led to an offer to join the faculty as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Networks course, a role that recognized my skills and deep understanding of complex networking concepts.
