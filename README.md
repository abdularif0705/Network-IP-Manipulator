# Network-IP-Manipulator

## Introduction
The Network-IP-Manipulator is a Python cybersecurity tool that uses multiple threads to find computers on the local network and then removes their internet access by overwhelming them with TCP or UDP packets. Its purpose is to expose and assess network protocol vulnerabilities in the structure of Wi-Fi within local area networks (LANs).

## Project Overview
I developed this tool with my classmate Brett as our capstone project for a Computer Networks course. This application reflects a deep dive into networking concepts and stands as a testament to the practical implementation of networking principles, bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world network security practices.

## Features
- **IP Online Detection**: Monitors and reports the status of devices within a network.
- **Specific Port Detection**: Evaluates the security of network ports by assessing their accessibility.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: Executes TCP/UDP flood attacks to assess the resilience of networks under high traffic conditions.
- **Node Geolocation Mapping**: Identifies the physical locations of network nodes.
- **Network Topography Scan**: Scans and documents the LAN, listing IP and MAC addresses of all active hosts.

### Career Advancement
The successful deployment of this project led to an offer to join the faculty as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Networks course, a role that recognized my skills and deep understanding of complex networking concepts.
