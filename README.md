# Network-IP-Manipulator

## Introduction
The Network-IP-Manipulator is a Python cybersecurity tool developed to demonstrate the real-world application of network protocols and their vulnerabilities within a local area network (LAN). By leveraging multithreading and socket programming, this tool performs tasks such as identifying active devices, scanning ports, and simulating network stress via controlled TCP or UDP flood attacks. The purpose is to unearth and understand potential vulnerabilities within Wi-Fi network structures.

## Project Overview
As a capstone project for a Computer Networks course, this application embodies a comprehensive application of networking concepts. Created by myself and my colleague Brett, it served as a demonstration of practical networking knowledge.

## Features
The Network-IP-Manipulator comes with a set of targeted features:
- **IP Online Detection**: Checks the online status of network devices.
- **Specific Port Detection**: Assesses the openness of designated ports on devices.
- **TCP/UDP Flood Attack**: Employs flood attacks to gauge network defences against traffic spikes.
- **Node Location**: Identifies the estimated physical location of network nodes via geolocation.
- **Node LAN Scan**: Maps out the LAN, listing IP and MAC addresses of all active hosts.

### Personal Achievement
Post-completion of this project, I was honoured with an offer to join the faculty as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Networks course. This opportunity was in recognition of my exemplary skills and solid understanding of complex networking concepts, underscored by the successful deployment of this project.

## Conclusion
The Network-IP-Manipulator is not just a tool, but a reflection of theoretical knowledge applied in a practical, hands-on environment. This project stands as a testament to my intricate understanding of network protocols, security challenges, and the implementation of multi-threaded applications.
